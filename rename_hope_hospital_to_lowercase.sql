-- Solution: Update all Hope Hospital records to lowercase "hope"
-- Execute this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Step 1: Check current hospital names
-- ============================================
SELECT 'Before Update:' as status;
SELECT DISTINCT hospital_name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM room_management

ORDER BY hospital_name;

-- ============================================
-- Step 2: Update "Hope Hospital" to "hope"

UPDATE room_management
SET hospital_name = 'hope'
WHERE hospital_name = 'Hope Hospital';

SELECT 'After Update:' as status;
SELECT DISTINCT hospital_name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM room_management
GROUP BY hospital_name
ORDER BY hospital_name;

-- Expected Result:
